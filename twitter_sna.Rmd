Installing packages
---

This handout uses the following packages, which you will need to install if you haven't already:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("RTextTools")
devtools::install_github("kasperwelbers/corpus-tools")
devtools::install_github("kasperwelbers/semnet")
```

Downloading Tweets
---

Note that you need to setup OAuth first, see the handout on "Using API's from R"

Let's download tweets from UK MP's before and after the brexit referendum:

```{r, eval=F}
library(twitteR)
mptweets_after = searchTwitter("list:Tweetminster/UKMPs", n=2000, since="2016-06-23", until="2016-06-25")
mptweets_before = searchTwitter("list:Tweetminster/UKMPs", n=2000, until="2016-06-22", since="2016-06-15")
mptweets_after = plyr::ldply(mptweets_after, as.data.frame)
mptweets_before = plyr::ldply(mptweets_before, as.data.frame)
```


Constructing DTM
----

The first step in frequency based analysis is to create a document-term matrix,
containing the frequency of each word in each document (tweet).

We use the `create_matrix` function from the `RTextTools` package.
This can strip punctuation etc. automatically, but since we want to preserve #hashtags and @mentions
but strip hyperlinks, we need to do some custom processing:


```{r, message=F}
library(RTextTools)
tweets = rbind(mptweets_after, mptweets_before)
text = gsub("https://.*?( |$)", " ", tweets$text)
text = gsub("[^A-Za-z0-9#@_]+", " ", text)
dtm = create_matrix(text, removePunctuation = F)
rownames(dtm) = tweets$id
```

From this DTM we can create subsets using the regular matrix/data frame subsetting syntax (`dtm[rows, columns]`).
For example, we can create a DTM with only the hash tags and visualize that as a tag cloud:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(corpustools)
dtm.hash = dtm[, grepl("#", colnames(dtm))]
dtm.wordcloud(dtm.hash, freq.fun = sqrt)
```

We can use the `term.statistics` command to get frequency information from a corpus, 
for example to get an overview of the most frequent hash tags:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
stats = term.statistics(dtm.hash)
stats = arrange(stats, -termfreq)
head(stats)
```

# Comparing Corpora

A useful way to get more useful information from a corpus is by comparing different subsets of it,
for example from different sources, periods, or split on a specific keyword.
In this example, we can compare the 'before' and 'after' tweets to see how hash tag use changed.
To show the most typical 'before' tags, we take the 'after' tweets as selected corpus 
and sort on ascending overrepresentation (so the most underrepresented words are displayed first).

```{r}
cmp = corpora.compare(dtm.hash, select.rows = as.character(mptweets_after$id))
cmp = arrange(cmp, over)
head(cmp)
```

We can also display this information in a contrast plot,
showing the most typical 'before' tags to the left, and the 'after' tags to the right:

```{r, warning=F}
with(arrange(cmp, -chi)[1:100, ],
     plotWords(x=log(over), words = term, wordfreq = chi, random.y = T))
```

# Constructing a social network

To create the 'who mentions who' network, we select only the @-words from the DTM,
and then extract the tweet-mention pairs. 
By adding (and normalizing) the screen name of the tweet author as sender
and stripping the at-sign from the addressee, we have  data frame of sender-addressee pairs:

```{r}
dtm.ats = dtm[, grepl("@", colnames(dtm))]
mentions = dtm.to.df(dtm.ats)
mentions$sender = tolower(tweets$screenName[match(mentions$doc, tweets$id)])
mentions$addressee = gsub("@", "", mentions$term)
head(mentions)
```

We can aggregate this to see who mentions whom, and remove all self-references and references to non-MPs:

```{r}
edges = aggregate(cbind(weight=mentions$freq), mentions[c("sender", "addressee")], sum)
edges = edges[edges$addressee %in% edges$sender, ]
edges = edges[edges$addressee != edges$sender, ]
head(edges)
```

Now, we can create an `igraph` object from the edge list:

```{r}
g = igraph::graph.data.frame(edges)
vcount(g)
```

So we now have a social network with 210 vertices (MPs), and we can use that to e.g. select the most
central MP (using betweenness centrality):

```{r}
head(sort(betweenness(g), decreasing = T))
```

To visualize this network, we first select only the largest component, apply clustering, and then use the built-in plot function:

```{r, message=F}
library(semnet)
g = decompose(g, max.comps=1, min.vertices=10)[[1]]
V(g)$cluster = edge.betweenness.community(g)$membership
g = setNetworkAttributes(g, cluster_attribute=V(g)$cluster)
plot(g)
```

# Constructing a semantic network

To construct a semantic network of all co-occuring words, we can use the `coOccurenceNetwork` function
from the `semnet` package:

```{r}
dtm.words = dtm[,!grepl("[#@]", colnames(dtm))]
g = coOccurenceNetwork(dtm.words)
vcount(g)
```

This network is too large to display directly, but we can extract the backbone of the 50 most important words
and then select the largest component:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
g = getBackboneNetwork(g, max.vertices = 50)
g = decompose(g, max.comps=1, min.vertices=10)[[1]]
vcount(g)
```

Now, we can cluster the graph and plot it:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
V(g)$cluster = edge.betweenness.community(g)$membership
g = setNetworkAttributes(g, cluster_attribute=V(g)$cluster)
plot(g)
```

As you can see, you would probably want to apply more preprocessing, e.g. removing stopwords, lemmatizing/stemming,
selecting only certain parts-of-speech, and/or applying dictionaries or thesauri.

With tweets, one thing we can also do is limit ourselves to the semantic network of hash tags:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
before = mptweets_before$id
dtm.tags = dtm[rownames(dtm) %in% before, grepl("#", colnames(dtm))]
g = coOccurenceNetwork(dtm.tags)
g = decompose(g, max.comps=1, min.vertices=10)[[1]]
V(g)$cluster = edge.betweenness.community(g)$membership
g = setNetworkAttributes(g, cluster_attribute=V(g)$cluster)
plot(g)
```

\newpage

# Combining the social and semantic networks

As a final example, we can create a network that combines the social network (who mentions whom)
with the hash tag network (who uses which tags).

To do this, we first create the edges for the sender -> tag networks:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
dtm.tags = dtm.tags[row_sums(dtm.tags) > 0, col_sums(dtm.tags) > 0]
tags = dtm.to.df(dtm.tags)
tags$sender = tolower(tweets$screenName[match(tags$doc, tweets$id)])
tags$addressee = gsub("@", "", tags$term)
tagedges = aggregate(cbind(weight=tags$freq), tags[c("sender", "addressee")], sum)
head(tagedges)
```

Now, we can combine these edges with the social network edges created above,
and create a graph for all edges with weight >= 2:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
g = igraph::graph.data.frame(subset(rbind(edges, tagedges), weight>=2))
g = decompose(g, max.comps=1, min.vertices=10)[[1]]
g = setNetworkAttributes(g, cluster_attribute=grepl("#", V(g)$name))
plot(g)
```

# Exporting graphs

You can export graphs to a number of formats using the `write.graph` function:

```{r, eval=F}
write.graph(g, file="graph.net", format="pajek")
```

This function does not support the gephi format, however.
To export to gephi we use the rgexf package:

```{r, eval=F}
library(rgexf)
gefx = igraph.to.gexf(g)
print(gefx, file="graph.gefx")
```
