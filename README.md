# Text and Network Analysis with R

This is the material for the **Text and Network Analysis with R** course as part of the [Networks in a Global World (NetGloW) conference](http://ngw.spbu.ru/). I will use this page to publish slides, hand-outs, data sets etc. As the title indicates, the workshop will be taught almost completely using R. If you don't use R yet, please **make sure that you install R and Rstudio** on your laptop. 

This repository hosts the slides (html and source code).
The source code for all handouts is published on my [learningR page](http://vanatteveldt.com/learningr/ "Learning R"):

## Session 1: Managing data and Accessing APIs from R

In this introductory session you will learn how to use R to organize and transform your data and how to obtain data by accessing public APIs such as from Twitter, facebook etc.
